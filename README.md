## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergio-atreides/Challenge-04---recipe-page/main/screenshot.png)

Hi! This is my attempt with the first DevChallenge.io challenge: a 404 page.

I have a long background developing desktop apps with .NET but I'm a noob developing for web. For now, I have only acquired knowledge in HTML and CSS and I am taking my first steps in Sass and SUIT CSS methology, so I've tried to use it here.

### Built With

- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)


## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/OEKdUZ6xs0h99C38XVht) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.
